                        <span class="howtosubtitle">Capital Gains </span>
                      -  the amount of profit from the asset donated or sold. Ex. $100,000 of shares/crypto bought, then sold for $1,000,000. You would type the full amount + principle since it is all donated to the CRT
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <span class="howtosubtitle">APY</span>
                      -  The amount you expect your money to grow per year. we put 4% as a very safe default.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <span class="howtosubtitle">Payments %</span>
                      -  The amount you will withdraw per year. Calculations must be made to ensure the charity gets 10% of the initial amount donated.
                        You want a good ratio of maximizing payments while minimizing taxes per year. Ex. making 12% could mean getting $30k more over the term, but you are now
                        paid more in the top tax bracket at the beginning years, so a middle ground is better, while this gives much more to charity due to compounding.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <span class="howtosubtitle">Length of Trust</span>
                    -    The time until the trust expires and donates leftover money to the charity or DAF of choice. longer is better due to compounding.
                        we default to 20 years (max length) to grow the most, although most people will want to choose a life term which last until death.
                        this is only available to those over 27.5 and we cannot measure a variable amount of years, so we stick with 20 to show the simple difference
                        if the trust is not used, and stock/shares sold.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <span class="howtosubtitle">Crut or Flipcrut</span>
                     -   Read about the differences in a crut, crat, nimcrut, flipcrut in the Valur link above.
                        a crut will payout of the principle starting year 1 no matter if it gains or goes down. a Nimcrut only pays out when you gain, since we are
                        only calculating 20 years here, I don't give the option, although this option is highly valuable in a life term. a flipcrut starts as a nimcrut, then turns into a normal crut.
                        this is useful if you want to grow it for a few years, or maybe wait out volatile market conditions and not withdraw in that time. So you could flip after 1, 2, 5 years. But do not wait
                        too long, we actually want to get paid the most we can before the trust expires.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <span class="howtosubtitle">Years until Flip</span>
                     -   as stated above, a good option might be waiting 1,2 or 5 years to grow the money, also this could give you time to set up other tax advantaged things like business losses reducing taxable income.
                        but remember, we have the deduction from donating assets to the Trust, so it would be smart to not wait too long, since those deductions can only be carried 5 years.

                     -   The chart is only showing the amounts IF assets are donated to the CRT. NOT if you sold -> pay tax -> then get payments
                        The principle amount after growing amount set by APY %, then the next year shows the new princple
                        minus your payment % then + APY %.  the last year will be the amount left to your charity or DAF of choice.

                     -   The starting amount we have to invest, if you donate you have the full amount. While if you sell you pay capital gains tax first in a high % bracket
                        then get payments starting there.

                        gives you FAR less to invest, and makes your payouts lower over 20 years to compound invest.
